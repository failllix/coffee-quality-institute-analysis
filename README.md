## Idea / Motivation

As a coffee loving developer and enthusiastic coffee brewer and drinker, I wondered whether there was something interesting to find in data of qualified Q-graders tasting coffee.

Leading questions were:

1. What patterns can we find in coffee tasting data?
1. Can we predict coffe tasting results based on meta data about the bean?
1. How relatable will the results be to our daily coffee drinking experience and purchase decisions?
## Data cleaning
Eventhough the data was precleaned already, upon first review of the data I stumbled over some funny things that I would like to share and what measures I have taken against.
