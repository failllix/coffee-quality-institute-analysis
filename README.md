## Idea / Motivation

As a coffee loving developer and enthusiastic coffee brewer and drinker, I wondered whether there was something interesting to find in data of qualified Q-graders tasting coffee.

Leading questions were:

1. What patterns can we find in coffee tasting data?
1. Can we predict coffe tasting results based on meta data about the bean?
1. How relatable will the results be to our daily coffee drinking experience and purchase decisions?
## Data cleaning
Eventhough the data was precleaned already, upon first review of the data I stumbled over some strange things which needed adjustment. In the end I had 41 features with 874 usable data samples. Some of the features contained less, but I did not use those for my investigations.

### General
1. Removal of unimportant features like: Farm name, Lot Number, Producer, Owner, ...
1. Selection of only Arabica samples (low count of Robusta samples + very different beans)
1. Removal of NaN, empty and zero values
### Altitude
During inspection of the mean altitudes (m), I spotted a weird value of  190164.0, which would be somewhere in space. After a quick Google search of the altitudes in the country of origin, I figured that the measurement must be in centimeters instead of meters. I found a few more which seemed to be done in decimeters. Obviously I corrected these values and afterwards got a new maximum of 4287.0m, which looked better to me.
### Total weight
As we were not given a total weight feature but Bag weight and bag count, I thought I would simply calculate the total weight myself. However I quickly spotted that the values of bag count were not numerical and included both kilogram and pound measurement. So I had to transform pounds to kilograms first and afterwards was able to calculate a new feature with the total weight.
However, looking at a histogram of the data I spotted a unreasonably large range with huge outliers, which was the reason why I decided to exclude those.
### Color
The color one was rather simple, as the only thing were "None" entries instead of blank or NaN values in some samples. They could be easily excluded.
